# Design Guidelines - GX-MODY WhatsApp AI Bot

## Project Type Analysis
This is a **backend service project** (WhatsApp bot integration with OpenAI), not a frontend web application. Therefore, traditional visual design guidelines are not applicable.

## No Frontend Interface Required
The core functionality is:
- WhatsApp message receiving/sending via webhook
- AI-powered responses using OpenAI
- Conversation context management
- No visual user interface needed

## Recommendation
If you want to **add an admin dashboard** or **management interface** for the bot, please specify requirements such as:
- Bot statistics/analytics viewing
- Conversation history monitoring
- Settings configuration
- API key management interface
- User management

Without a web interface requirement, this project focuses purely on backend logic, API integrations, and webhook processing.

**Note:** If you'd like to add a dashboard or control panel for managing GX-MODY, please let me know what features you need, and I'll provide comprehensive design guidelines for that interface.
